            <p class = "brief_introduction"> I currently studying data science at Johns Hopkins University. I have strong background in Mathematics 
                and Statistics, extensive experience in Data Analytics, Deep Learning and Model deployments.<br><br>
            I continue upgrading my knowledge in Machine Learning /Signal Processing /Software Engineering and would love to train myself as a DS/MLE/DE in the future. My recent project includes 
            developing ML models to predict the University admission rate. Would like to work on ML applications to the audio signal processing in 2022.
